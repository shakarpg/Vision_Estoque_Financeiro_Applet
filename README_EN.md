# Vision Stock-Financial

## Description (English - en)

This applet, developed in Google AI Studio and deployed via Cloud Run, has the primary mission of optimizing communication and data integration between the Inventory and Finance departments. By leveraging the power of Gemini Flash 2.5 Pro for image understanding, "Vision Estoque-Financeiro" transforms the process of recording and validating information, minimizing errors and accelerating decision-making.

The communication problem between inventory and finance often arises from manual processes, data entry, and the lack of a single, visual source of truth. Our applet addresses this by allowing inventory staff to quickly and efficiently capture visual information, which is then processed and structured for the finance department.

## Problem Solved

Inefficient communication between inventory and finance can lead to:
*   **Entry Errors:** Incorrect entry of codes, quantities, or values.
*   **Delays:** Slow reconciliation of invoices with stock receipts.
*   **Discrepancies:** Difficulty identifying the cause of differences between physical and book inventory.
*   **Lack of Visual Evidence:** Difficulty auditing or verifying transactions without photographic records.

## Key Features

*   **Simplified Data Entry:** Capture photos of inventory documents (invoices, labels, counting reports) directly through the applet.
*   **Multimodal Image Understanding (Gemini Flash 2.5 Pro):**
    *   **Text Extraction (OCR):** Identifies and extracts text from documents (invoice numbers, suppliers, values, descriptions).
    *   **Code Reading:** Recognizes barcodes and QR codes for product identification.
    *   **Element Recognition:** Potential to identify types of items or packaging.
*   **Structured Summary Generation:** Transforms visual information into clear, formatted textual summaries, ideal for the finance department.
*   **Flexible Integration (Conceptual):** The structured output can be sent to internal chat systems, emails, or other systems (ERP) via APIs.
*   **History and Audit Trail:** Maintains a visual and textual record of transactions for future reference and auditing.

## How It Works

1.  **Image Capture:** An inventory employee uses the applet to take a photo of a document (e.g., goods receipt invoice, product label with barcode, counting report).
2.  **Gemini Processing:** The image is sent to the Google Gemini Flash 2.5 Pro API.
3.  **Information Extraction:** Gemini analyzes the image, extracting relevant data such as invoice number, supplier, items, quantities, values, and product codes.
4.  **Summary Generation:** The applet compiles the extracted information into a readable, standardized summary.
5.  **Communication:** The summary is presented to the user for confirmation and then automatically sent to the finance department's preferred communication channel.

## Benefits

*   **Error Reduction:** Minimizes typing errors and human interpretation.
*   **Operational Agility:** Accelerates the recording of inflows/outflows and financial reconciliation.
*   **Transparency and Evidence:** Provides an auditable visual record of transactions.
*   **Time Optimization:** Frees up employee time for higher-value tasks.
*   **Improved Collaboration:** Facilitates clearer and more accurate communication between teams.

## Technologies Used

*   **Google AI Studio:** Development environment for prototyping and testing the Gemini model.
*   **Gemini Flash 2.5 Pro API:** For real-time multimodal image understanding capabilities.
*   **Cloud Run:** For scalable, serverless, and cost-effective deployment of the applet's backend.
*   **Frontend (Conceptual):** A lightweight web or mobile interface for user interaction (e.g., HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
